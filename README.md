pynite: Python bindings for OpenNI/NiTE
=======================================

This is a minimal set of Python bindings for the OpenNI and NiTE libraries for interacting with
depth sensors such as the Kinect, Asus, and PrimeSense.

I'm using SWIG.

I have a PrimeSense Carmine 1.09 short range sensor.
